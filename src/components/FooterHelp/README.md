# Footer help

Footer help is used to refer users to more information related to the product or feature they're using.

## Best practices

Footer help should:

- Be positioned at the bottom of the interface
- Provide links to help that's related to the experience on the screen
- Not be used to promote features or provide explanations for how something works
- Never link to information designed to upsell to users
- In rare cases, link to blog posts when there isn't any help documentation to help users with the most logical step in the workflow

### Footer help

By default, footer help should link to information in the Idiogi Help Center and should follow this content pattern:

- Learn more about {feature}

Links should be:

- Clearly labeled: Users shouldn't need to guess where they'll end
