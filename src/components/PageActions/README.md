# Page actions

Page actions let users take key actions at the bottom of specific pages in the interface. This is important because sometimes the primary
call to action is hard to access when users are at the bottom of a page.

## Best practices

Page actions should:

- Include a single primary action on the right. It should be the same as the primary action that should in the title bar at the top of the
  page.
- Include a maximum of two secondary actions, but doesn't have to include any secondary actions.

## Content guidelines

### Call to action buttons

Buttons should be:

- Clear and predictable: users should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive users by mislabelling
  a button.
